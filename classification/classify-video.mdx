## 1. Send a POST request
To classify a video, you need to make a **POST** request to `/api/classification_video` with the required parameters (for details on the parameters, refer to the [API Reference](../api-reference/classification/classify-a-video) section).
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://backend.identifai.net/api/classification_video \
  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: <api-key>' \
  --form frames=5 \
  --form with_llm=true \
  --form with_morphing=true
```
In the response you will receive the hash of the classified video.

## 2. Retrieve the results
Use the provided hash to retrieve the classification results by making a **GET** request to `/api/classification_video/{hash}` (for details on how to structure this request, see the [API Reference](../api-reference/classification/get-a-video-classification-result) section).
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://backend.identifai.net/api/classification/video/{hash} \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: <api-key>'
```
The response will provide the classification results for the video in JSON format. For video classification, the video is divided into frames. In the response, you will find a results array that includes the classification outcomes for each model applied to each analyzed frame, and a verdicts array containing the results for each heuristic used.
<Note>
  The classification may not be finished yet! If the classification is not yet complete, continue sending the GET request until the result is available.
