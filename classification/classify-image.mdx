## 1. Send a POST request
To classify an image, you need to make a **POST** request to `/api/classification` with the required parameters (for details on the parameters, refer to the [API Reference](../api-reference/classification/classify-an-image) section).
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://backend.identifai.net/api/classification \
  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: <api-key>' \
  --form with_llm=false \
  --form with_morphing=false
```
In response you will receive the hash of the classified image.

## 2. Retrieve the results
Use the provided hash to retrieve the classification results by making a **GET** request to `/api/classification/{hash}` (for details on how to structure this request, see the [API Reference](../api-reference/classification/get-an-image-classification-result) section).
```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://backend.identifai.net/api/classification/{hash} \
  --header 'X-Api-Key: <api-key>'
```
The response will contain the classification results for the image in JSON format. In the response, you will find a results array, which includes the classification results for each model used, and a verdicts array, which contains the results for each heuristic applied.
<Note>
  The classification may not be finished yet! If the classification is not yet complete, continue sending the GET request until the result is available.
