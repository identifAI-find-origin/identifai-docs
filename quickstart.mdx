## Setup your development
Learn how to use IdentifAI's APIs.

### Get your API Key
An API Key allows you to authenticate your requests and access the API services.
To acquire your API key and begin your development journey, follow these simple steps:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="circle-user" iconType="solid" title="Create a user profile and log in to the platform">
    If you don’t have an account yet, visit our [platform](https://web.identifai.net/register) and **create a user profile**.
    <br/> Once you’ve completed registration, **verify your email** and **log in** with your credentials.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="bars" iconType="solid" title="Access the user menu">
    After logging in, you will find yourself on the **main dashboard** of the platform.
    <br/> Click on the **user icon** (<Icon icon="circle-user" iconType="solid" />) in the top-right corner of the screen to open the **user dropdown menu**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="key" iconType="solid" title="Select the API Key option">
    In the dropdown menu, select the **“Api-Key”** option. From there, you can **view** or **reset** your API key.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
Your API key is ready to be used — start using our APIs now!
<Note>
  Store the API key in a secure location and avoid sharing it publicly.
</Note>

### Make an API call
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
    Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
    don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
    your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
    successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
    of the repo.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
    [Commit and push your changes to
    Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
    for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
    the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
    update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
  </Accordion>
