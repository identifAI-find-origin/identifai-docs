## How it works
Utilizing cutting-edge artificial intelligence algorithms and degenerative models, IdentifAI API **deeply analyzes** visual characteristics, textures, pixels, and audio signals to identify typical signs of artificial generation.
<br/> Unlike generative models, our **degenerative models** focus on identifying the peculiarities that distinguish real content from synthetic ones.
<br/> Ideal for social platforms, verification systems, and applications that require a high level of security, IdentifAI offers reliable support to **enhance trust** in sharing and consuming digital content.
<br/> Integrating our API means contributing to preventing the spread of false or manipulated information, protecting content integrity, and **fostering trust among people**.

## Key Features
- **Precise recognition** between real and artificial images and videos
- **Instant reports** with detailed reliability scores
- **Multi-format** support for various file types (JPEG, PNG, MP4, WAV, etc.)
- **Easy integration** into your applications via versatile APIs

Join us in building a more transparent and **reliable digital future**, where technology helps protect content integrity and **promotes trust** among users.
