- Access the user menu: After logging in, click on your name or the user icon in the top-right corner of the screen.
- Select the API Key option: In the dropdown menu that appears, select the \"API Key\" option. From there, you can view or generate your API key.
Now you are ready to use your API key in our API!

## How to use the API
To use the API, first make a **POST** request to start the classification. Then, use the provided ***hash*** from the **POST** request to retrieve the results.
### 1. Image Classification
* To classify an image, you need to make a **POST** request to `/api/classification` with the required parameters (for details on the parameters, refer to the *\"Classification\"* section below).
* In the response, you will receive the ***hash*** of the classified image.\n  
* Use the provided ***hash*** to retrieve the classification results by making a **GET** request to `/api/classification/{hash}` (for details on how to structure this request, see the *\"Classification\"* section below).
* The response will contain the classification results for the image in JSON format.
In the response, you will find a ***results*** array, which includes the classification results for each model used, and a ***verdicts*** array, which contains the results for each heuristic applied.
If the classification is not yet complete, continue sending the **GET** request until the result is available.
### 2. Video Classification
* To classify a video, you need to make a **POST** request to `/api/classification_video` with the required parameters (for details on the parameters, refer to the *\"Classification\"* section below).
* In the response, you will receive the ***hash*** of the classified video.
* Use the provided ***hash*** to retrieve the classification results by making a **GET** request to `/api/classification_video/{hash}` (for details on how to structure this request, see the *\"Classification\"* section below).
* The response will provide the classification results for the video in JSON format. For video classification, the video is divided into *frames*.
In the response, you will find a ***results*** array that includes the classification outcomes for each model applied to each analyzed frame, and a ***verdicts*** array containing the results for each heuristic used.
If the classification is not complete, continue sending the **GET** request until the final results are returned.
### 3. All Classifications
The `/api/classifications` endpoint will return all the image classifications made by a user. This will list the results of all past image classification requests.
### 4. User Management
The **POST** `/api/user` endpoint allows you to create a user, while the **DELETE** `/api/user` endpoint is used to delete a user (For the structure of the requests, see more in the user section below).
